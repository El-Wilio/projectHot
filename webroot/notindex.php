<h1>ProjectHOT</h1>
<p>ProjectHOT is the web version of what will hopefully become a Pokemon TCG AI that will then grow to draw conclusions and suggest builds.</p>
<p>The project will likely follow these first draft phases:
<ol>
	<li>Back end: Understand the rules of the game</li>
    <li>Back end: Understand the cards' structures</li>
    <li>Back end: Have a database of the current metagame ofo cards</li>
    <li>Make the AI</li>
    <li>Run the AI to come up with "perfect plays" for decks, along with the odds of pulling one off. Produce bell curves to suggest how to play.</li>
    <li>Have the AI run thousands of test games simultaneously to give matchup odds. Use the AI toolbox to spit out why certain decks beat others.</li>
    <li>Finally, use the AI to suggest deck builds and practice against it</li>
</ol>
